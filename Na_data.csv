This indicates the rural economy is going better.” While this bodes well for two-wheeler makers, healthy economic activity, strong replacement demand and robust government spends on infrastructure projects will help lift up sales of commercial vehicles.Last quarter, passenger vehicles sales increased by 8.3% to breach the 1 million mark and close at 1,012,285 units.

"HDFC Bank’s credit card business has received a major push from its cobranding strategy in recent months. The private lender has distributed a million-plus cards with Tata Group’s super appTata Neuand around 120,000 with foodtech majorSwiggy, two people in the know told ET.HDFC Bank had announced its partnership with Tata Neu around August 2022 and with Swiggy around July 2023.For context: There are around 4.5 million ICICI Bank andAmazonPay cobranded cards in use. This partnership was launched in 2018.“The cards are being used mostly for grocery shopping, food delivery, purchase of electronic items and bill payments,” said one of the persons familiar with the development.“HDFC Bank is not only using Swiggy or Tata Neu to acquire customers, (but) the bank is pushing these cards through its own distribution channels too, both online and offline… This helped the number grow exponentially,” the person said.ETtechAlso read |Swiggy joins co-branded credit card rushEmailed queries to HDFC Bank,Tata Digitaland Swiggy went unanswered as of press time Thursday.Data from theReserve Bank of India(RBI) shows that by the end of November last year, HDFC Bank had issued around 19.1 million credit cards, the largest among all the major lenders. Overall, there are around 96 million active credit cards issued in the country.Also read |Paytm talks to banks for co-branded cardsA win-win propositionWhile cobranded cards are mostly sold through the strength of the partner brand, adoption is higher where it can be used for rewards across a large ecosystem of merchants.With a super app like Tata Neu, consumers have the advantage of using the cards across the entire Tata Digital platform. For Swiggy, consumers can use the card to order food online, eat out at restaurants and order groceries. The Swiggy card offers cashback on ecommerce portals like Amazon andFlipkart, too, which has expanded the scope of usage for these cards.“Tata Neu cards can be used for extra points onAir Indiaas well, which is not part of Tata Neu but is part of the Tata group, hence the opportunities to earn rewards are higher,” the person quoted above said. “The Swiggy card is mostly being used in tier one and metro cities, given that is where a large chunk of Swiggy’s customers are,” he added.The second person aware of the development said that for Swiggy, the share of transactions through its own credit card continues to be small compared to other payment modes.Also read |After UPI, now credit cards overtake debit card transactionsBanking on consumer spendingA senior banker said cobranded cards make more money when they get used actively outside the ecosystem of the cobranded partner, where typically rewards are not very high.A large share of the revenue earned by banks on these transactions otherwise is expended to fund the rewards, he said.“As of now, usage of these cards within the respective ecosystem is higher and the bank is bearing the cost of the business, but the bet is that going forward, more and more usage will happen at other outlets, which will make the product profitable,” the banker said.Overall, banks have pushed the pedal on this business and cobranding is an important part of the strategy.For example, Axis Bank – which has cobranded cards with Flipkart, Vistara airlines, andfintech startup Fibe(previously Early Salary) – has a credit card book of Rs 35,842 crore, up 72% year on year, the highest among its retail portfolio.Also read |NPCI leans on bank partnerships to push RuPay credit cardsTap to acquireFor consumer brands, getting on the cobranded bandwagon means partially lowering customer acquisition costs while significantly improving loyalty on the platform similar to having a loyalty programme or subscription plans. The caveat is that the platform has to be of a minimum scale for it to be attractive for banks to join hands.For banks, this is also a means to activate dormant users. Industry insiders said that historically it has been seen that after getting a cobranded card, customers become more active.Another reason why banks engage with consumer brands and companies is that additional gains start pouring in for financial institutions as dormant users become more active after getting a cobranded card.“For banks, this means that there is an opportunity to activate some of these customers on credit cards, and gain from any growth in income down the line these customers will have,” a Gurgaon-based industry consultant said. “This was one of the reasons why internet companies are increasingly seeing interest from banks for cobranded partnership.”",BANKING / FINANCE,1

That would peg the stake value at Rs 3,825 crore. Invus is a European family office and investment arm. Founder chairman of Capital Foods and a former advertising boss turned food entrepreneur Ajay Gupta will retain his 25% stake for now but Tatas will buy him out too in future helping him unlock further value.TCPL will also be buying a controlling stake in Organic India for a Rs 1800 crore valuation from Fab India.Fabindiais backed by Premji Invest and Lighthouse Capital, and owns over 40% stake in Organic India, based in Lucknow.ET in its September 21 edition was the first to report that TCPL was the frontrunner for Capital Foods, that since 1995 had created a unique niche by launching a series of products with ‘desi’ flavours. These include Ching’s Secret instant noodles, soups, condiments, curry pastes and frozen entrees along with the Smith & Jones range of ginger-garlic paste, niche sauces and baked beans. Goldman Sachs since late 2022 had launched a formal sale process that attracted the likes of Nestle the world's largest foods company, and The Kraft Heinz Co, Norwegian food giant Orkla, owners of MTR Foods among others. Kotak Mahindra has been advising Tatas.ET in its August 4 edition was also the first to report that Tatas and ITC were eyeing a significant stake in Organic India the maker of a wide range of premium organic teas and foods supplements.The acquisition of Tatas will now pit TCPL directly against Nestle’s Maggi, which leads the Rs 5,000 crore branded instant noodles market with a 60% share. The Maggi franchise is part of Nestle’s prepared dishes and cooking aids business. Other players in the category include Top Ramen, Wai Wai and Patanjali.Organic and wellness products have been growing in high-double digits, specially post Covid-19, and are forecasted to reach ?75,000 crore by 2025, according to the 'Indian Organic Sector Vision 2025' report by the commerce ministry.This market is expected to grow as much as 16-18% a year till 2026-27.

It clocked a 50% jump in revenue through brand extensions and new launches at low incremental costs.But Capital Foods and Organic India will be the first significant acquisitions in several years by Tata Consumer which had been focused on sharpening and scaling up its inhouse portfolio of brands. The portfolio of Capital Foods will especially get the heft of Tata Consumer's distribution network and marketing muscle, said highly placed officials close to the development. Tata Consumer will have access to an expanded global Indian diaspora with brands that have a pan Indian cuisine unlike the other more regional centric brands. The Tata company will also get brands that offer better business margins in the food space, officials said.Tatas declined to comment. GA, Invus was not available for comment. Mails sent to Ajay Gupta and FabIndia spokesperson on Thursday evening did not generate any response till press time.According to analysts who track TCPL, it’s been on a multi-year transformation journey, expanding from being a tea-and-salt company to a broader food and beverage franchise after the Tata Group rationalised and consolidated its portfolio, which includes a merger with Tata Coffee expected by end FY24. In May 2020, it bought out PepsiCo’s 50% stake in NourishCo Beverages Ltd, an equal JV between the two companies that houses brands such as Himalaya packaged water and GlucoPlus. However, it’s much-talked-about Rs 7000 crore takeover bid for Bisleri — India's largest bottled water brand — didn’t succeed after close to two years of dialogue.Buying Organic India offers Tata Consumer expansion into new categories.

Under the 'pay for performance' principle, the criteria for additional variable incentive is to prioritise the quality of service to the stores, such as servicing larger networks of stores, availability of several new category packs and next-day delivery.The company said fixed margin has been reduced by up to 60 bps to ensure fair play between the distributors who focus only on wholesale and those who opt for higher cost retail service with wider range availability. And to compensate for this reduction in the fixed margin, the variable margin has been increased by up to 130 bps.HUL rolled out the structure across 110 top cities in October, which covered nearly 400 distributors.This led to the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF) flagging concerns, saying it will fight to reinstate the margins and even warned of a boycott of their products.

"Price-tags for most daily household, personal and food products will fall in the next few months withconsumer companiesrolling out products with increased grammage or pack weight especially forsmall packspriced at Rs 5-20.Electronic companies are also postponing price hikes for refrigerators and air-conditioners despite a 3-4% increase incommodity costssuch as steel, aluminum and polypropylene in the last 2-3 months, while mobile phone manufacturers are going to launch 5G smartphones in the sub-Rs 10,000 segment, industry executives said.""We continue to pass on the cost benefits to the consumer either through reduced pricing or through increased grammage. We believe that this will lead to an increase in volume demand. In lower price packs, grammages have been increased by 5 to 10%,"" said Neeraj Khatri, chief executive, India and Saarc business, at Wipro Consumer Care.All these pricing actions are part of an all-out effort by the companies to improve volume sales which is crucial for the industry to expand their sales. The industry is expecting volumes to grow significantly from March-April onwards with lower and stable pricing, increased government spending ahead of general elections, and higher farming income aiding the recovery process. For FMCG, it is also to fight the increased competition from regionalbrands.Mayank Shah, senior category head at biscuit major Parle Products, said grammage has been increased for small packs by 12-15% which hitherto was only for large and mid-sized packs. “Volume growth has started to come in and needs to gather pace. Also, the pack size increase will help to fight the increased competition from regional players who are back with a vengeance after input costs came down,” he said.As per a latest report by Nuvama Institutional Equities, Rs 5 pack comprises 32% of FMCG volumes, Rs 10 at 22% and Rs 20 at 10%. The report said large companies will eventually regainmarket shareand remain competitive by offering more value at the mass end by cross subsidy from premium end whereby local competition will gradually fade out in two more quarters. Hindustan Unilever has recently cut prices of soaps and laundry products, the report said.For electronics, the industry is battling a recent increase in commodity costs but is going to absorb it. Godrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi said while there is a case of 2-3% price hike, the industry is going to absorb it. “It’s the wrong time to increase prices since the main priority is to improve demand,” he said.Smartphone brands too are going to launch more 5G models in sub-Rs 10,000 segment to revive buoyancy in that segment. Market researcher Counterpoint’s research director Tarun Pathak said the market recently saw a couple of 5G devices in the sub and near Rs 10K price brand by brands like Itel and Lava.“With a big potential market, brands like Lava, Nokia HMD, Xiaomi and its sub-brand Poco are collectively working to bridge the 5G gap in the lower segment. Fierce competition is driving prices down, and it's anticipated that 5G smartphone prices can go down further and reach the Rs 9,000-9,500 range. This is despite the challenges of rising component cost,” said Pathak.Volume has grown faster than value on the sales charts for several consumer goodscategoriesin the last quarter of 2023, aided by a reduction in prices and what companies see as a sign of recovery in consumption. Companies like Adani Wilmar, Marico, Dabur and Godrej Consumer Products have recently said that there has been volume-led growth in their sales in the October-December period. But value growth came under pressure as companies cut prices from early 2023 to pass on the benefit of lower raw-material costs.Last quarter, crude oil prices are down 20% versus recent peak whilst palm-oil prices are close to 16-17% off recent peak. A recent JM Financial report said it expects gross margin expansion of 326 basis points in the third quarter for the home, personal and food companies. ""For a few companies like Britannia, GCPL that have hedged their input-costs well last year, margin-recovery was already well-underway during 3Q last year thus creating a somewhat tougher base,"" the report added.",CONS.

This marketing authorization grantsOil Marketing Company(OMC) status to IPM like the other OMCs such asIndian Oil,Bharat Petroleum,Hindustan Petroleumand private sector OMCs likeReliance, Nayara and Shell. IPM will set up retail outlets (petrol pumps) across the country to undertake fuel retailing. In the first phase, the Ministry has allowed IPM to set up 100 outlets within 5 years. In fact, IPM is the first Ministry-authorized start-up private OMC to commence operations on the ground”.The company added, “All IPM retail outlets will have facilities for fuel sales, one new-age, environment friendly ‘green fuel option’ like CNG or Bio Diesel and/or electric vehicle ‘battery management’ options. Apart from fuel/energy options, the IPM outlets are proposed to be equipped with customer convenience options so that a visit to the IPM outlet is expected to rejuvenate both man and machine. In fact, all IPM outlets will offer hitherto unexperienced levels of technology and innovations-driven customer experience”.The company added that pursuant to the above policy initiative, Assam’s Numaligarh Refineries Limited (NRL) is the first oil supplier in the country to proactively sign Fuel Sale/Purchase Agreement for supply of fuel to such newly approved private OMCs. Also, Assam has been the first state in the country that has proactively propagated the message regarding creation of such private OMCs at the district level and advised the districts to look into the possibility of making available suitable government sites for retail outlet development by such private OMCs. IPM is the first private-sector OMC to commence its pan-India operations from the state of Assam.The company added that IPM looks forward to commencement of its journey from the ‘thriving hub’ for industry, logistics and infrastructure that is Assam. Apart from outlets at prominent locations, IPM will also fulfil its ‘remote area’ obligation by setting up outlets in remote areas of Assam, thereby providing infrastructural and logistical boost, promoting entrepreneurship development (including focus on women entrepreneurs) and generating direct and indirect employment”.",ENERGY,3

Europe's share in India's diesel exports was 39% in December, up from 32% in December '22 and 37% in November.India didn't export any diesel to the US in December. The share of the US in India's total diesel exports was 14% in December '22 and 4% in November.India's diesel export growth ""is a result of strong refinery runs and softer domestic demand,"" said Serena Huang, analyst at Vortexa.In November, diesel exports grew 43% year-on-year to 669,000 bpd. Indian refineries ran above their nameplate capacity of 5 million barrels per day (mbd) in November, processing 5.17 mbd of crude. Domestic diesel demand fell 3% year-on-year in November, leaving refiners with a surplus to export.In December, the domestic consumption of diesel again fell 2.5% year-on-year but was just about 1% higher than in November.Europe has become a large consumer of Indian diesel after it imposed sanctions on the import of diesel from its traditional supplier Russia. India's exports of diesel shifted significantly to the West from other markets after the outbreak of the Ukraine war, which prompted western nations to shun Russian refined products.India has been a significant exporter of diesel for years.

"Anil Agarwal-ledSerentica Renewables, which raised Rs 3500 crore this week for its hybrid power plants in Rajasthan and Maharashtra, wants the government to focus on bringing in a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for critical components in the transmission, distribution, and generation segment.Serentica Renewables ChairmanPratik Agarwaltells Kalpana Pathak that many smaller components that go into grid strengthening, such as transformers, reactors, GIS systems, submarine cables, and HVDC systems that are not produced in India and are imported could gain immensely from the fillip. Edited excerpt:How much funding hasSerenticaraised in total so far?We started Serentica to provide round-the-clock (RTC) green power to large commercial and industrial customers. Over the past 12 months, we signed contracts to deliver roughly 1800 megawatts of round-the-clock power to several entities within theVedantagroup which consumes almost 2.5% of the total Indian power consumption. The 1800 megawatts of PPAs will require us to build close to 4000 megawatts of capacity, which we are building across three states-- Rajasthan, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. This entire project is going to cost us about $3.1 billion and the debt is going to be about $2.2 billion. Of this $2.2 billion, this $425 million is the first ECB loan that we have locked in. Also, of the $ 2.2 billion, including this $425 million, we have closed about $1.5 billion of debt financing. Some are sanctioned and some are disbursed. So, we have another $700 million to close, which we are in discussions with various lenders.High cost is a concern for setting upbattery storagesystems. How is your company addressing that?Storage is essential for RTC power. So, what we have done is a unique strategy; we have partnered with a leading storage developer and taken about 15% of their capacity on a take-or-pay basis of pump storage capacity, which is commissioning from next year. This way, it serves two purposes. We will have storage by next year to be used at our requirement and to combine with wind and solar to deliver RTC power to anybody. Also, we can get that storage at a significantly cheaper cost than battery storage. That gives us a very big advantage over others when we are competing in the marketplace and offering power because I am pricing in pump storage and other people are pricing in battery storage. For the next 2-3 years, anybody who has access to pump storage will be the most competitive in the marketplace when it comes to any kind of round-the-clock business, whether it is with corporates or with the government, like Solar Energy Corp of India. I expect that in about 3-4 years we should begin to see an accelerated reduction in battery pricing, and by then there could be a parity between pump storage and batteries.Of the four segments in C&I - EVs, telecom, public infra, and mining & construction, which one do you see the most growth coming from for BESS?A few things are driving the growth of the power C&I market. Before we talk about green, in India, we must understand that 50% of the entire power consumption in India which is roughly about 1.5 trillion units, 700 billion units is C&I load. Out of that 700 billion units, 90-95% is still served by government owned DISCOMs. We all know the challenges that come with government-owned DISCOMs. Today, data centers, large export oriented textile mills, and cement plants require high-quality power, with high uptime, at reasonable prices. The demand is massive. We think that is not far that even people who are currently being served by DISCOMs would like to disconnect and switch to a private supply.Any expectations from the budget for the renewable segment?Through the product-linked incentive scheme, the government has done better in pushing Indian manufacturing and creating a supply chain for the essential components of the value chain. We strongly believe that they need to keep continuing that trajectory. Instead of focusing on the vital major components, there is a large number of smaller components that go into grid strengthening and go into large clouds, such as transformers, reactors, GIS systems, submarine cables and HVDC systems. Now, many of these components are critical. Without this, the power sector cannot grow. So, you simply cannot add more solar and wind unless you can add more HVDC lines to the country. Now, unfortunately, some of these products are not produced in India at all. One or two large countries are controlling the supply chain of those products. The government must recognize other important pockets because 500 gigawatts of renewable is not small. We are looking for more manufacturing-sector like PLI schemes for critical components within the transmission, distribution, and generation balance of the country.Given the currentIPOboom, any plans to list Serentica?One must have an eye on the capital markets as most of our businesses are capital-intensive. There are several businesses in the whole group. Vedanta is also demerging and has 17-18 unique businesses. But among the power businesses, there are three verticals-- manufacturing business, where we make about Rs 7000-8000 crores worth of products that go into the power transmission sector - cables, conductors etc. That is a private unlisted company now.Then we have Serentica, which is a renewable C&I company. Then we have the transmission business, where we build transmission lines on build own operate basis. The transmission business is not likely to go public, which is a business that will probably get a better valuation and better appetite from the private markets.The business that is most suitable for public markets is the manufacturing business. However, we are currently going through a demerger process of SPTL - breaking it into the manufacturing business and the transmission BOT business. Once the demerger is done by June, we will again take stock of what options are available to fund the growth of that business.The three options always will be internal cash, debt, and private equity or public markets. At that time, whichever makes more sense, we will do it. Two years ago, we had filed for an IPO as well. However, at that time the markets were not suitable, hence, we called off the process.",RENEWABLES,9

"Jindal Power has proposed to top a bid byAdani Power, led by billionaire Gautam Adani, for a thermal power plant, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, asIndialooks to drum up investment in coal-fired power.The tussle for the 1,980-megawatt plant in central India, ensnared in insolvency proceedings, comes after the power minister called last November for more private investment to meet a dramatic rise in electricity demand.In a letter, Jindal Power, a unit of Jindal Steel and Power , has asked India's insolvency court to allow it to participate in an auction for the Amarkantak project, said the sources, who sought anonymity as they were not authorised to talk to media.Jindal Power has offered a better value than Adani's bid, added the sources, who are aware of the letter, which has not been previously reported.""Adani Power, with its revised offer, looked the best suitor so far,"" one of the officials said.The official was referring to a bid of 41 billion rupees ($494 million) the company made last month, just as the insolvency court prepared to give final clearance to another bid from the lenders to the project.Adani Power's bid, an increase from a previous offer of 29.5 billion rupees, exceeds the bid of 30.2 billion rupees made in Dec.2022 by state-run lendersPower Finance Corp(PFC) and REC Ltd.Adani Power and Jindal Power did not respond to Reuters' queries.Private investments in coal-based power in India started dwindling after 2018, hit by lower demand and an ambitious national thrust in renewable energy.Now the Amarkantak project goes up for a fresh auction ordered by the insolvency court, which has limited participation only to those who had put in financial bids.Adani Power's revised bid will form the base price for the auction, the two sources said.Jindal Power, which had not put in a financial bid despite submitting an expression of interest early in the insolvency process, was excluded from the auction and is now seeking court permission to join it.Reuters could not determine how much Jindal Power intended to bid for the partly operational project, which belongs to insolvent industrial group Lanco and is located in the central state of Chhattisgarh.It is one of many distressed coal-fired private power stations mired in insolvency proceedings in recent years as owners did not have fuel supplies or the funds to complete them.",IND'L GOODS / SVS,5
"The Enforcement Directorate Friday said it has arrested five persons in connection with an alleged Rs 56,000 crorebank loan fraudlinkedmoney laundering caseagainst erstwhileBhushan Steel Ltd.Former vice president (banking) of the company Pankaj Tewari, former VP (accounts) Pankaj Agarwal, ex-chief financial officer Nittin Johri, Ajay Mittal, the brother-in-law of former promoter Neeraj Singal, and Ajay Mittal's wife and sister of Neeraj Singal, Archana Mittal were taken into custody under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on Thursday, it said.They were sent to three days ED custody by a court after they were produced over two days, the agency said.After completing the corporate insolvency resolution process, Bhushan Steel was taken over byTata Steel Ltdin 2018.According to the ED, Bhushan Steel Limited's former managing director Neeraj Singal and his associates formed several shell companies and the promoters and entities linked to BSL ""rotated funds from one company to another through a chain of multiple entities"" as part of an alleged bank loan fraud.The money laundering case stems from a charge sheet filed by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), an investigative agency under the ministry of corporate affairs.""Ajay Mittal and Archana Mittal knowingly received proceeds of crime to the extent of Rs 70 crore. They also mortgaged property of BSL and routed the funds to the family of Neeraj Singal,"" the agency said in a statement.It added that Nittin Johri, Pankaj Tewari and Prem Agarwal are ex-employees of BSL who were the ""main persons"" in-charge of accounts and banking transactions.""The said three persons are directors in various paper companies managed by Neeraj Singal for rotation of funds. They manipulated the accounts of BSL and were also involved in providing fake documents and details to the bank so as to raise loan funds,"" it said.They were ""actively involved"" in diversion of bank funds, the agency alleged.Neeraj Singal was arrested by the ED after it raided him in June 2023. A charge sheet under various sections of the PMLA was filed against him and others in August last year. Singal is currently lodged in jail under judicial custody. Assets worth Rs 61.38 crore have also been attached in this case in November, 2021.Bhushan Steel Limited, Neeraj Singal and his associates formed several ""shell"" or dummy companies and they rotated funds from one company to another through a chain of multiple entities, the ED said.The agency alleged that funds were circulated to infuse capital, buy property and for other personal purposes not intended by the banks.The promoters, directors and the officials of BSL prepared ""forged"" documents and made fraudulent representations before the banks to discount letters of credit and ""diverted"" the funds back into their own companies with mala fide intentions, it said.Investigators suspect that funds were ""misappropriated"" against the fabricated letters of credit created in favour of JSW Steel limited and Hindustan Zinc Limited.""The misappropriated funds were diverted to other group/associated companies, causing wrongful loss to theState Bank of Indiaand thePunjab National Bank,"" the ED said.",IND'L GOODS / SVS,5

"With India's longest bridge that connects South Mumbai with the mainland across theArabian Sea, Mumbai has got a vital artery which can give a phenomenal boost to business and industry as well as make daily life easier for Mumbaikers.TheMumbai Trans Harbour Link(MTHL), or Atal Setu, as it will be called now, links Sewri in Mumbai to Nhava-Sheva on the mainland in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, establishing faster connectivity between the island city of Mumbai and the Navi Mumbai on the mainland, and decongesting the perennially choked metropolis as well as opening new vistas of development. Spanning 22 km, with a 16.5 km extension into the sea,Atal Setuwill shorten travel time between Mumbai and Navi Mumbai to 20 minutes from two hours.Atal Setu is the centrepiece of an infrastructure surge in the making in Mumbai. Brokerage firm Jefferies had estimated that the Mumbai metro area, India's financial nerve centre and home to 23.6 million people, would complete $10 billion in projects over the 18 months to end-2024, and an additional $60 billion over the next three to seven years. These projects will synergise with Atal Setu to speed up Mumbai.Faster connectMumbai is India’s most vehicle-congested city. It has more than 2,000 per km of road. It also has the most densely packed intra-city railway corridors which carried more than 8 million people daily in pre-pandemic times. Mumbai’s car population has nearly doubled in the last decade, but the length of its road network lags far behind Delhi and Bangalore. The city has a road network of roughly 2,000 km, less than a tenth of Delhi’s 29,000-km sprawl. It’s barely even a fifth of Bengaluru’s grid.In such a scenario, Atal Setu has come as a blessing. Its real potential, though, will be unleashed once the Sewri-Worli elevated corridor, the Eastern Freeway-Marine Drive tunnel, the proposed Chirle-Palaspe connection with the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, and the international airport in Navi Mumbai are completed.All these projects will make the Rs 21,200 crore Atal Setu accessible to people from a much wider geography. These projects will be completed in phases over five years and ensure that the western waterfront and the eastern waterfront of the island city are fully integrated with the web of tunnels and flyovers coming up in south Mumbai.Atal Setu, on which the ideal-conditions travel time between Sewri and Nhava Sheva is 20 minutes, will be an obvious choice for those on the southern tip of the western suburbs once the Sewri-Worli east-west connector is completed - it is at the 50% stage today.Residents of the western suburbs, especially in the Santacruz-Bandra belt, can take the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, which will provide an interchange facility to hop onto the Worli end of the Sewri-Worli link and head straight to the MTHL. ""It is estimated that 15% of traffic on the MTHL will pass via the proposed Sewri-Worli corridor. The distance between the east and west coast can be completed in 10 minutes as against the present 40 to 60 minutes,"" an MMRDA official has told TOI.Once the Sewri-Worli project is completed, a motorist starting from suburban Bandra would be able to reach Navi Mumbai in under 40 minutes. The MMRDA is also digging an underground link between Orange Gate and Marine Drive to link it with the Mumbai Coastal Road. The project will help those living in Pedder Road, Malabar Hill and Nepean Sea Road enjoy a signal-free ride to the MTHL.The traffic to Pune too is expected to take a massive jump once the short-cut to the Expressway is built from Atal Setu at the Chirle end across the harbour.Business and economic growthSuch a crucial piece of infrastructure in a choked city is bound to yield an economic dividend by heightening business activity, bringing in more industry and creating more jobs, not to speak of the obvious logistic advantage to various businesses of shorter transport and travel times.Vikram Ahuja, co-founder, ANSR, and CEO, Talent500, has told TOI that the city, which constituted 15%-16% of India's digital tech talent pool and was already one of the preferred hubs for MNCs looking to set up global centres, would benefit massively from Atal Setu. ""The launch of the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link will hugely benefit and encourage Mumbai's attraction as a leading destination for global capability centres. Global companies can expect faster connectivity to the upcoming airport and access to a wider talent pool, and benefit from the real-estate ecosystem, which will flourish in and around the new link,"" Ahuja said.Atal Setu is perceived as an engine of economic growth. Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde wants growth centres on the lines of Bandra-Kurla Complex in close proximity to the bridge’s landing in Navi Mumbai, TOI has reported. The bridge will ensure an easier link for labour and construction material for South Mumbai, and spur redevelopment besides opening up employment opportunities.Navi Mumbai is also expected to see heightened activity with the completion of MTHL and development around the upcoming airport, said a Colliers India reportThe bridge is poised to transform the everyday travel experience for commuters from south and central Mumbai, reducing the current two-hour travel duration to just 20 minutes. The improved connectivity is likely to spur commercial and business activities in Navi Mumbai. “The MTHL will undoubtedly be a boon for Navi Mumbai's overall economic development, including and especially the real estate sector in the region. In the next 10 years, we expect Navi Mumbai to not just complement the economic growth of MMR, but co-lead it, with other major infrastructure projects including the international airport also bound to have a substantial impact,” Raajesh Prajapati, MD Prajapati Constructions, has told ET.RK Jain, who owns three industrial components factories in the Navi Mumbai area south and east of the city centre, told Reuters that Atal Setu and other infrastructure - including a new airport and light rail line - will help to turn the region from a ""backward area"" into a ""premium suburb"".Navi Mumbai is rapidly developing and is home to one of India's biggest ports as well as new hospitals and universities and global retail chains such as IKEA Atal Setu, said the Colliers India report, is expected to lead to a 20-25% increase in annual leasing activity from 2025 onwards compared to 2022 levels, with about 9 million square feet of supply infusion, primarily in IT stock, in the next three years in Navi Mumbai. Additionally, it will establish Navi Mumbai as a data center hotspot, with planned investments of $ 3-4 billion in the next 3-5 years.Navi Mumbai is poised to turn into an IT hub, and Atal Setu will be a big help. The government is promoting Navi Mumbai's growth as an IT hub, and a number of major companies have already established offices there. The Maharashtra government recently issued a government resolution permitting the service sector on 85% of the land of Navi MumbaiReal estateMumbai's realtors are excited about Atal Setu. Speaking exclusively to ET NOW, Niranjan Hiranandani, CMD, Hiranandani Group, said that Atal Setu would do to Mumbai what Noida and Gurugram did to Delhi. Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Group, said that MTHL could trigger a momentum in real estate, which could be extended to faraway places like Alibaug. ""We) expect a 50-60 per cent price hike in areas around MTHL,"" he said.""You are going to get enough land equivalent to half the land of Mumbai. This will bring (proximity to) Panvel, Lonavla, Khandala and Karjat. So the entire scenario in housing and social infrastructure will change,"" said Hiranandani.Atal Setu will also bolster the Navi Mumbai property markets as the connectivity and further infrastructure development is likely to result in surge in real estate activity, demand and prices.“Factors such as lifestyle, easy commuting, improved connectivity, and relatively lower property prices (35-45% less despite being a planned city) in Navi Mumbai will likely influence homebuyers' decisions. Affordable housing in Navi Mumbai is still within the range of Rs 30-40 lakh,” Bhavesh Shah Joint MD, Today Global Developers, has told ET.While the property market of the entire region is expected to gain, more impact will be seen in micro markets such as Panvel, Ulwe, Dronagiri that will get a direct linkage to the bridge, experts say.The enhanced connectivity is likely to push demand for affordable housing options as more people may explore Navi Mumbai as a viable residential destination as against other locations in Mumbai that are at least two-three times more expensive.(With inputs from TOI and agencies)",IND'L GOODS / SVS,5

"Source image – freepikIn recent times, the prevalence of infertility has surged, affecting one in every six couples, as reported by The World Health Organization. This growing challenge has spurred constant advancements in reproductive medicine and fertility treatments, ushering in a new era of hope for those seeking to build their families.The inception of in vitro fertilization (IVF) in 1978, marked by the birth of Louise Brown, the first test-tube baby, propelled fertility science to unprecedented heights. IVF has since become a prominent solution for addressing infertility.Evolution in Reproductive ScienceIntracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)An instrumental breakthrough in addressing male infertility, ICSI involves injecting a single high-quality sperm directly into an egg, significantly enhancing the likelihood of successful fertilization and the generation of healthy embryos. Serious causes of male infertility have become treatable due to this advancement.CryopreservationCryopreservation stands as a pivotal advancement, allowing individuals to preserve eggs, sperm, or embryos for future use.Oocyte cryopreservation, commonly known as egg freezing, enables women to postpone conception without compromising egg quality and quantity due to advanced maternal age. It can also be used to preserve eggs in cases of ovarian cancer, where the eggs may be damaged by chemo and radiation therapy.Similarly, sperm and embryos can be frozen for future use, offering a lifeline to those undergoing medical treatments or surgeries affecting fertility.Artificial Intelligence (AI)AI is capable of analyzing vast volumes of data, like image scans and medical records, to find patterns and predict a patient's chances at a successful conception. This can increase the likelihood of a successful pregnancy and assist medical professionals in choosing the best course of action.Advanced AI algorithms simplify processes like identifying viable embryos for implantation and quickly locating sperm in severely infertile men.Stem Cell TreatmentStem cell therapies have emerged as a significant development, particularly for females grappling with infertility. Stem cell therapy can aid in the development of ovarian cells and oocytes. In cases where women have a thin endometrium, endometrial cells are used to fix the issue and increase their overall fertility.Spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) treatment, on the other hand, is used to cure male infertility. This method involves transferring the testicular stem cells to a test tube, cultivating them, and gently pushing them toward becoming fully developed sperm.FSH for Eliminating InjectionsFSH is a crucial hormone that controls ovarian follicle development and expansion in women, resulting in the release of fully developed eggs during ovulation. In men, sperm production in the testes is stimulated by FSH.When FSH is taken orally in the near future, it can improve ovulation induction as well as address male infertility, and eliminate the need for injections for ovarian stimulation during IVF or egg freezing.Blastocyst CultureA blastocyst is the final stage of an embryo, generated five to six days following the sperm fertilizing the egg. Blastocyst embryo transfer is a specialized IVF method in which a blastocyst stage embryo is transferred to the womb. Blastocyst is beneficial in case of multiple IVF failures.Assisted Hatching TechniqueCreating a tiny opening in the outer layer of the embryo through the Assisted Hatching Technique increases the chances of implantation, thereby improving pregnancy prospects.Time-Lapse Embryo ImagingTime-Lapse Embryo imaging enhances the uninterrupted culture conditions and allows the continuous monitoring of embryos, helping embryologists to identify and select the best embryos for transfer.Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)PRP is a concentrated blood product with a high platelet density. PRP is used in a variety of fertility treatments, including IUI and IVF, to thicken the uterine lining and increase endometrial receptivity during embryo transfer. Also it is helpful in case of females having low AMH and Low ovarian reserve. It is most commonly utilized in patients who have had a history of recurrent implantation failures.These remarkable advancements have significantly elevated the success rates of IVF, contributing to the eradication of infertility. Medical and technological breakthroughs continue to streamline the processes of freezing, transferring, and implanting healthy embryos, paving the way for successful pregnancies.Insights from Progenesis IVF Experts""Since its inception in 1978, IVF has transformed the landscape of infertility. Innovations like ICSI, IMSI, PICSI and assisted hatching have bolstered the success rates of assisted reproductive technology (ART), leading to a surge in individuals seeking infertility treatments. Now, with even more advanced techniques and artificial intelligence , IVF is bound to provide more successful results,"" remarksDr. Narhari Malagaonkar, Chief Fertility Consultant at Progenesis IVF Fertility Center in Maharashtra.Dr. Sonali Malagaonkar, Senior Fertility Consultant at Progenesis IVF Fertility Center in Maharashtra, adds, ""Reproductive technology has advanced to a point where genetic diseases can be prevented from being passed onto offspring with PGT-A. Additionally, women now have the freedom to choose the ideal time for pregnancy, thanks to advanced fertility preservation options like cryopreservation.

"Did you know that diabetes has surged fourfold in the last 40 years, marking an alarming rise in mortality risk compared to major non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer or cardiovascular ailments? This concerning trend, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), calls for urgency in action. However, there’s hope. Type 2 diabetes—a condition that stems from the body’s glucose regulation issues—can be effectively managed through lifestyle shifts.Endocrinologists Dr. Pramila Kalra, Dr. Manoj Chadha, and Dr. P. K Jabbar convened to demystify diabetes. Dr. Pramila Kalra, Professor and Head of Endocrinology at Ramaiah Medical College and Hospital, Bengaluru, Dr. Manoj Chadha, a consulting endocrinologist at PD Hinduja Hospital and Medical Research Center, Mumbai, and Dr. P. K Jabbar, Professor and Head of the Department of Endocrinology, and Director-CEO of the Indian Institute of Diabetes Intervention, shared insightful, sustainable-yet-smart lifestyle strategies and solutions in a panel discussion moderated by Miloni Bhatt, Editor - Digital Broadcast, EconomicTimes.com as part of a webinar titled ‘Beat Diabetes With Lifestyle Modification’. This webinar is the second installment of the USV diabetes awareness multimedia series—Beat Diabetes Win Life—in collaboration with The Economic Times. Their goal was to empower patients and vulnerable populations at risk, offering feasible approaches to kickstart diabetes management through lifestyle modifications—simple, adaptable, and tailored for contemporary living.Beat Diabetes With Lifestyle ModificationThe dreaded ‘D’ word—diabetes—no longer carries the same weight as a life sentence. While traditional diabetes management relied solely on medications, there’s a growing emphasis on the pivotal role lifestyle changes can play in supporting and enhancing the well-being of individuals suffering from diabetes. In the second installment of the USV diabetes awareness multimedia series, titled ‘Beat Diabetes With Lifestyle Modification’, some of India’s leading endocrinologists convened to impart savvy and sustainable strategies for embracing transformative lifestyle shifts.Combating the ‘hurry, worry, curry’ lifestyleEnlightening the audience about this dreaded lifestyle disease, Dr. Chadha pinpointed the culprit as our 'fast-paced 'hurry, worry, and curry' lifestyle,' capturing the essence of our everyday life. 'We need to reconsider our eating habits, manage stress levels, incorporate physical activities into our routines, and allocate time for various aspects, including sufficient sleep.' Above all, the Mumbai-based endocrinologist emphasized that 'when we speak about lifestyle, it's not merely a temporary adjustment but something sustainable and fitting for each individual.'Dr. Jabbar dived into this paradigm of sustainable shifts, rather than fleeting fixes, through the lens of a balanced diet. Since 'we are what we eat,' a balanced diet holds a significant spot in diabetes management. Apart from being well-informed about recommended dietary guidelines, individuals often encounter challenges in adopting and, more importantly, sustaining healthy eating habits.Dr. Jabbar recalled that her mentor used to 'emphasise that there's no specific diet solely for diabetic patients.' Rather, it's about modifying your diet. 'Cutting back on heavy or fatty foods, excessive carbohydrates, or high-sugar content is crucial.' According to Dr. Jabbar, a balanced diet by definition means regulating portions and including items like brown rice instead of white, limiting sugary items, and incorporating salads, which provide positive energy and aid bodily functions.While implementing these recommendations entirely across the population might not be practical, making small, achievable changes is crucial for positive health. 'As our textbooks emphasise, the most crucial step is dietary modification, coupled with exercise,' said Dr. Jabbar.Dr. Kalra seconded Dr. Jabbar, adding that 'When we discuss lifestyle modifications with our diabetic patients, adherence can be a challenge. It needs to be tailored to each individual.From brisk walks to heavy lifting, build your exercise regimeSince Dr. Jabbar already highlighted dietary changes, Dr. Kalra shared insights into another vital component of diabetes management: exercise. 'Often, time constraints are cited as a barrier to exercise. We emphasise flexibility in timing—whether morning, afternoon, or evening—to encourage regularity,' said Dr. Kalra.Contrary to popular perceptions, even brief breaks, like walking every 30 minutes while working on a laptop, can make a difference, meaning lifestyle modifications can seamlessly integrate into daily routines. 'For instance, opting to walk while commuting or adding a stationary cycle at home for cycling in the evenings or mornings can effectively maintain health parameters. These adaptable suggestions align with individuals' lifestyles, as a dedicated exercise routine might not always be feasible for everyone,' added Dr. Kalra.Expanding on Dr. Kalra's insights, Dr. Chadha provided a deeper understanding of how physical activity plays a role in regulating blood sugar levels for individuals with diabetes. 'Expanding on Dr. Kalra's point, it's crucial to emphasise the detriment of prolonged sitting; it's often termed the 'new smoking.' Continuous sitting is equally harmful, if not worse, than smoking.'Dr. Chadha emphasised that following a few simple steps, such as getting up every 30 minutes, even for a few seconds, can be highly beneficial. Incorporating activities like walking, games, dancing, or even basic weight training can be easily integrated into daily routines, even within corporate settings during short breaks. Dr. Chadha shared another critical insight, an emerging concern in recent years: the significance of bone health in diabetes. Diabetics face an increased risk of fractures, surpassing that of non-diabetics. Therefore, the emphasis on lifestyle changes and weight-bearing exercises doesn't just aid in diabetes management but also reduces the risk of fractures and addresses bone health concerns, shared Dr. Chadha.Dr. Chadha also allayed fears for those who are possibly diabetic and possibly at a higher risk of fracture, as some might have reservations against physical exercises. Dispelling such fear, he further explained that the spectrum of physical exercise encompasses various activities like regular walking, dance exercises, or outdoor games, allowing a person to avoid contact sports if that's a concern. Additionally, weight-bearing or stretching exercises don't necessarily involve heavy lifting; tools like stretch bands are effective and safe. They work on energy levels without the need for specific weight loads. These exercises have remarkable effects on muscles and bones simultaneously. There's no need to be apprehensive; these exercises are safe and immensely beneficial.""Obesity and diabetes managementA 2021 study highlighted that there were 101 million people with diabetes and 136 million with pre-diabetes, while 254 million had generalised obesity. Abdominal obesity stands at 40% across the population, with female abdominal obesity at 50%. This makes it evident that obesity is a critical concern for diabetes and raises the risk for others. Therefore, obesity management is a significant part of supporting the overall health of individuals with diabetes.Dr. Kalra explained that when addressing obesity, it's not merely about BMI but also about visceral obesity—a harmful type of fat causing increased insulin resistance and inflammation. This predisposes individuals to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and elevated cholesterol levels. Additionally, obstructive sleep apnea is prevalent among those with obesity, disrupting sleep patterns and contributing to higher blood pressure and risks of cardiovascular issues and diabetes. Fatty liver, characterised by fat deposition in inappropriate areas, adds to these complications.""So, when a patient adheres to an exercise regimen or undergoes treatment for these concerns, alongside lifestyle adjustments, we monitor and assess these factors comprehensively. Our focus isn't solely on insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, or cholesterol; we also address fatty liver, a significant predisposing factor not just for cirrhosis or liver damage but also for heart disease. In managing obesity, we address a spectrum of issues such as obstructive sleep apnea, fatty liver, diabetes, prediabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol,"" explained Dr. Kalra.Obesity management isn't solely about shedding pounds; weight loss is quantified in percentages—3%, 4%, 5%, or more—because a 5% or higher weight loss has shown significant benefits across various parameters, including fatty liver and insulin resistance,"" said Dr. Kalra.The Professor and Head of Endocrinology at Ramaiah Medical College and Hospital, Bengaluru, also expanded on various methods, including medications, aiding in achieving significant weight loss, even surpassing 10 to 15%. This weight reduction contributes to alleviating insulin resistance and can even lead to “diabetes remission,” a concept gaining attention in contemporary discussions.""Sleep and stress managementDr. Jabbar, building on Dr. Kalra's insights into sleep issues, emphasised the necessity for an average sleep duration of about six to seven hours to avoid accompanying medical conditions. He delved deeper into stress management and its impact on blood sugar control, while also elaborating on the significance of sleep in diabetes management.Stress has a profound link with our well-being, especially in diabetes management. Uncontrolled diabetes often intertwines with stress-related factors, affecting blood sugar levels. Sleep disturbances, such as snoring, are equally critical. Visceral or abdominal obesity, coupled with snoring, can lead to obstructive sleep apnoea—a condition beyond mere snoring. It's a serious medical issue impacting diabetes and hypertension control, affecting personal and professional spheres. Sleep disruptions hinder oxygenation, leading to fatigue and performance issues, not uncommon in workplace settings. Addressing snoring is crucial; lifestyle changes or minor surgeries can significantly alleviate these issues. Snoring isn't just a sound; it carries significant health implications and warrants attention for better diabetes management and overall health.Dr. Jabbar also highlighted some stress management strategies: Stress management can be approached through various methods, primarily through lifestyle adjustments. Adequate sleep plays a crucial role, and activities like exercise are beneficial in reducing stress. Sometimes, seeking guidance from counsellors or considering medications might be necessary for long-term management. Maintaining a work-life balance is vital. It's essential to delineate work hours from personal time and avoid routinely bringing work home. Additionally, taking regular breaks from work, as practised in several countries, is essential for mental well-being. Accumulating excessive leave days without utilising them might not be advantageous in the long run.Additionally, Dr. Chadha stressed the significance of regular monitoring in assessing the effectiveness of lifestyle modifications. He explained that monitoring is incredibly crucial. Often, discussions centre on medications or injections, but lifestyle modifications play an equally, if not more, significant role. Encouraging patients to monitor their sugar levels at home is vital. Even if it's not as frequent as multiple times a day, doing it once or twice a week provides insight and a sense of progress. Visiting the lab occasionally, as advised by the doctor, is also important.“I can assure you, as Dr. Pramila uses the word 'remission' in diabetes, it’s a reality, not fiction. However, it requires respecting your body, taking care of it, and monitoring regularly as advised by your physician, depending on the treatment you’re undergoing. I believe that the group of patients solely relying on lifestyle changes, without any medications, are the ones who can speak in terms of reversing or achieving remission,"" summed up Dr. Chadha.”",HEALTHCARE,4

The process can lead to more questions than answers.This series, theClass of 2024, aims to simplify the way to navigate the world beyond the campus by talking about the sectors with opportunities, ways to use online platforms and preparing resumes, among other things.Career-Boosting Courses for Early-Stage ProfessionalsOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIndian School of BusinessISB Professional Certificate in Product ManagementVisitIIM LucknowIIML Executive Programme in FinTech, Banking & Applied Risk ManagementVisitIndian School of BusinessISB Product ManagementVisitThe ninth of the 10-part series looks at the options for students who are unable to land a job throughcampus placements.For students graduating from colleges and universities this year, getting a job — the first for many — would be on top of their minds. And this year, the road might seem especially hard given the market trends. But looking at the broader implications of post-college life, experts say students should start imbibing the nature of career paths.S Pasupathi, Chief Operating Officer, HirePro, says that career paths may not always be linear, and individuals can face many types of setbacks in any chosen field. Students should develop a dynamic and flexible trait. If they do not get an opportunity in campus placements, they should start exploring the numerous other career options. “The job market can be competitive, and hitches may occur, but it is essential to remain proactive, stay persistent and remain adaptable to explore alternative paths and opportunities. If a candidate’s interests have evolved or if the person is not finding opportunities in the chosen field, consider reskilling and pivoting into a different career path,” he says.You Might Also Like:Class of 2024: How students can solve their way into employmentAcquiring industry-specific certifications is one way Pasupathi says candidates can become attractive to employers.Candidates who are sure of their field can consider pursuing postgraduate studies such as a master’s to enhance their qualifications.

Students can try their luck through online job portals, company websites and networking platforms. He asks freshers to not limit themselves to their degree’s field as the skills and knowledge can be transferable to other segments.Coursera says it has degree pathways that focus on skills-first learning, which aids in transferability. Students cannot afford to wait years for their degree to pay off, says the learning platform. So industry microcredentials have become an important part of degrees, creating hybrid credentials. Students earn a diploma and industry certificate and can use these to advance their career before graduation. This provides an immediate return on income on their education.You Might Also Like:Class of 2024: The job roles that promise big paydays for freshers next yearThe New Education Policy is also paving the way for more such innovations that can drastically improve the gross enrolment rates and reduce cost of private education.Foundit says students should be open to roles that may not directly align with their major but still allows them to develop transferable skills and gain experience.

Most smaller companies, startups and SMEs that may not participate in campus placements have their job postings on these platforms, says foundit.Then there are career fairs — both virtual and physical — that can help candidates land jobs of their choice. Job seekers can efficiently manage their time during virtual career fairs by scheduling specific time slots to interact with employers.The jobs platform suggests that graduates should not rule out freelancing and gig jobs. There are opportunities in writing, graphic design, web development, digital marketing and such areas. Also, these allow remote working opportunities; so students can save more and have time to add skills.TeamLease Edtech estimates that there are a significant number of people who seek to gain work experience before formally entering the job market. This often takes the form of apprenticeship programmes, like the one being implemented by CSC Academy in partnership with TeamLease EdTech. This collaboration aims to make India more employable, especially in rural areas. They plan to integrate degree programmes with practical on-the-job training, creating a pathway for students to develop real-world skills.The collaboration between CSC Academy and TeamLease EdTech aims to enroll one lakh (100,000) students in the next year, with programmes in diverse domains like banking, financial services, retail, IT, and more.These initiatives are also in alignment with the Skill India Mission, a government initiative aimed at training millions in new-age skills.The learnings and opportunities will vary and the career pathways will often not be linear.

"Earlycareerprofessionals building a successful career path tend to switch jobs as they look to grab better growth opportunities. However, make sure you get all necessary documents from the organisation you have resigned before starting at a new company.Read our special placement series| Class of 2024Career-Boosting Courses for Early-Stage ProfessionalsOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIIT DelhiIITD Certificate Programme in Data Science & Machine LearningVisitIndian School of BusinessISB Product ManagementVisitIndian School of BusinessISB Professional Certificate in Product ManagementVisitOne crucial document you must collect from the previous company is arelieving letter. It is provided by the employer and says yourresignationhas been accepted and you have been relieved of all your responsibilities as an employee.Employees may even get into legal trouble if they do not have a relieving letter from the previous employer.Unfortunately, most new hires are not aware of the importance of the letter, what all it must contain, how it is different from an experience letter, and such important factors. Here is a quick explainer about a relieving letter.You Might Also Like:IT freshers beware! Non-compete clauses woven into contracts are unenforceable in India, experts sayUnderstanding the importance and relevanceMurali Santhanam, CHRO, AscentHR, a comprehensive HR operations services provider, says a relieving letter is a document proving that an employee had a smooth exit from an organisation and is ready for a hassle-free transition to another.Prospective employers can take an employee’s inability to produce this document as a negative signal related to integrity, performance, behaviour, discipline or more.Of course, there are organisations that might not ask a new employee for a relieving letter. In such a case, a red flag should go up about the entity’s HR practices. Also, it is safer and a professional practice for an employee to always have relieving letters from all the organisations she has worked with.Some organisations that do not follow good HR practices may just not provide a relieving letter, or for that matter even an appointment letter, says Santhanam.You Might Also Like:Less than half of India's new graduates are job-ready: ReportIt is better to be wary of these organisations.Santhanam says a relieving letter may not be relevant in certain situations such as short-term contractual employment and part-time employment. In such cases, it is recommended that employees request a contract or part-time work completion certificate.A relieving letter is vital to show that an employee who has resigned has cleared all dues and has no work pending, says Sarbojit Mallick, co-founder, Instahyre, a job search platform. It also assists organisations to ensure that a person who has resigned is entirely released of their obligations and is not in possession of the company’s data or property.Relieving letter v/s experience letter: What is the differenceA relieving letter should not be confused with an experience letter. Both are important documents and have their own standing in an employment process.You Might Also Like:Are you a fresher looking for job? These are your must-have skillsSanthanam explains that a service certificate or work experience certificate is normally addressed as “To whomsoever it may concern”. It provides the name of the employee with the position held and the employment duration. It may sometimes have a statement detailing that the employee’s character and conduct during the time of employment were satisfactory or good.Relieving letters have more details. The document is given to an employee when he or she resigns from the company, says Mallick. “The HR department of the organisation validates the employee’s resignation letter and records the last date of employment in the relieving letter. The experience letter says what kind of experience the employee has.”Elements a relieving letter must containThe HR departments of most companies have their own formats for relieving letters. And a company with good HR practices would issue a comprehensive letter. But employees must know what the letter should have, so that it doesn’t cause any hurdles in subsequent employment opportunities.According to Santhanam, a good relieving letter will clearly state the name of the employee in full, the employee ID, location of work, date of joining, position held at the time of leaving, and the last working day. It will articulate that the employee in question has been relieved from his employment with effect from a specific date. It will also highlight that the full and final settlement has been made and there are no outstanding dues from either the employer or the employee. “It could end with a goodwill wish. It must always be signed by an HR manager or HR head or CHRO as the case may be or an authorised signatory or the CEO, MD, etc,” says the CHRO of AscentHR.Mallick says a relieving letter can be short and concise.“It might just say ‘Dear XYZ, you have successfully completed your tenure at this company as this job title from this date till this date. We appreciate your efforts towards the growth of the company and wish you luck in your future endeavours’,” he says.Can an employer deny a relieving letter to an individual?In normal circumstances, Santhanam says a separating employee is entitled to a relieving letter. However, companies can deny relieving letter to employees found to be indulging in unlawful activities; performing an action in violation of the employment contract/appointment letter; or an action that is against a published policy that could be related to violation of a code of conduct, unethical actions, POSH, integrity, performance, behaviour, discipline, absconding from work, etc.“Relieving letters are normally not issued to employees terminated for cause. In business parlance, termination is normally initiated by employers for violation or breach of a policy or contractual obligations,” he clarifies.Some companies deny employee a relieving letter when there is employment termination, says Mallick. Unsatisfactory code of conduct, parting ways on bad terms, not serving notice period, or breaching the employment contract in some way are a few factors that can lead to refusal of the letter from an employer’s end, he adds.",JOBS,7

"India’s high street space is set to expand substantially with some bigdevelopersincludingDLF, M3M,Omaxe, Group 108, and Dhillon Group looking to develop about three million square feet of retail projects withopen spacesin the next 2-3 years.There is a significant demand forhigh street retailspace acrossIndian citiesas the supply remains constrained with most developers focused on building largeshopping malls, industry insiders said.India has only 13.2 million sq ft of high street space available for retailers, while malls occupy seven times that space at 93 million sq ft, according to data by Cushman & Wakefield.At the same time, potential consumption at a high street is almost three times more than in a mall, the consultancy firm said.“India lacks modern organised high streets despite old markets doing quite well,” said Karan Dhillon, owner of Dhillon Group. “As a developer, we realised it and planned high street retail in Chandigarh, adding 1.5 million sq ft,” he said. Brands opening outlets in this new high street space in Chandigarh include Uniqlo, Starbucks, Decathlon and McDonald, Dhillon said.DLF, India’s largest listed real estate company, recently launched commercial plotted development in Gurgaon, spread across 8.69 acres. This will be developed as high street market on the line of DLF Galleria, which commands rental at par with the grade A malls in the region, company officials said.M3M recently announced a luxury high street retail and ‘Pentsuites’ – or, serviced studio apartments – as part of a commercial project in Noida. The project will be developed on a three-acre land parcel with saleable space of about 900,000 square feet – 550,000 square feet in retail and 350,000 square feet for studio apartments.“The recent surge in demand for high-street projects can be linked to the renewed interest in a hybrid model that integrates offices, retail spaces, recreational facilities, and food zones into a unified structure,” said Mohit Goel, managing director of Omaxe Group. “High streets have garnered positive feedback from tenants and investors due to their convenience and diverse amenities, attracting shoppers,” he said.Omaxe is developing over two million sq ft ofretail spacein different cities, majority of which is high street.RISING DEMANDProminent high streets in India command better rentals than malls.Rentals at Delhi’s Khan Market, for example, recently hit a record high of Rs 1,600 per sq ft per month, almost double of the costliest retail location of Mumbai and about four times that of Bengaluru.Recently, Titan leased 18,000 sq ft at Delhi’s South Extension in one of the biggest transactions at a high street location.Many brands, particularly in fashion and food & beverages (F&B) sectors, have been scouting for spaces in prominent high street locations.Poor availability of organised high streets in the country is one of the reasons for that, but there are other factors driving demand for high street retail space.Experts said fewer restrictions during Covid-led lockdowns at high streets made retailers prefer the open locations over malls, which either remained shut or operated with strict regulations for several months.Consequently, prominent high streets were the earliest retail hubs to resume operation after lockdown restrictions were relaxed post the first Covid wave.“A distinctive feature of high-street projects is the presence of retail spaces at lower levels and office spaces at upper floors, seamlessly integrated into the local environment,” said Amish Bhutani, managing director of Group 108. “Investors particularly favour high-street projects due to their adaptability, making them a sound business proposition,” he said.Group 108’s project in Noida called One FNG offers 3.8 million sq ft of office space and 300,000 sq ft of retail space.",RETAIL,10

"Indian law firmsare expanding their talent pool with younger partners – a trend triggered by the burgeoning demand for complex and specialized legal assignments in a fast-growing economy increasingly integrated with global money hubs.A boom inlegal businessamid a rise in M&A deals, a vibrant IPO market, rising litigations, constantly evolving uniform producer levy structures, and focus on corporate governance and ethical standards have prompted firms to promote younger professionals to the role of partners, said experts.The average age of attainingpartnershipin the country’s toplaw firmsis about 32-33 years, according to estimates.A study by legal search firm Vahura of more than 150 legal professionals who got partnership in the past three years shows that 47% were in the experience bracket of 8-10 years (30-32 years of age). About 20% were in the experience bracket of 11 years (33-34 years), 23% in the 12-14 years range, while about 6% partners had more than 15 years of experience.“Partnerships are generally being offered earlier globally too,” said Zia Mody, co-founder and managing partner, AZB & Partners. Today, lawyers are better trained and hence the path is quicker. More young lawyers are ready at an early stage to take on client-facing roles, she added.Demand from clients to have a Partner in an M&A deal, transaction or advisory has increased multi-fold in recent times, said top law firm officials.“One of the important value propositions that law firms give to clients is a high level of partner involvement. Hence, it is imperative for law firms to create more partners to cater to client delivery,” said Balanand Menon, Partner & Head-Consulting, Vahura. “The rise in demand for legal service has further intensified the need to widen the talent pool.”Among the top five law firms, Trilegal has only equity partners, while CAM, SAM, AZB and Khaitan have a mix of salaried and equity partners. The median compensation of an entry level partner is Rs 90 lakh-1.2 crore.Early promotion to Partner level also serves as a retention tool.“Indian law firms have been inundated with work in the last couple of years triggering a war for talent within the sector. Promotion to Partner level and creation of a fast growth path serves as a key to talent retention,” said Menon.However, the majority of the early partners in their early 30s are salaried, and the path to becoming an equity partner may have reduced only marginally, said experts.“Most firms have created a new category of a partner who remains on legal retainer and does not become an equity partner soon,” said Avimukt Dar, founding partner, IndusLaw.An equity partner in a law firm is a part-owner who gets a piece of the revenue the firm makes. They also have to chip in in case of losses.Partner MaterialThe ability to handle clients independently is the primary criterion, said top law firm officials.“Once a lawyer can command the respect of their clients (internal and external) and colleagues they are usually what one would call the ‘right fit’ culturally,” said Dar. “Soft skills will invariably play a big role. Another significant criterion is the ‘business’ case or the volume and value of work handled by the person, the practice group as well as the firm as a whole.”Veteran lawyers emphasise the need for specialisation to fast track to partner level.“They need to be specialists. Earlier, one needed to have proficiency in several legal areas to be a partner, while today one is often an expert only in one branch of the law,” said Vivek Chandy, joint managing partner of law firm JSA.“Being an expert in one branch of the law takes less time, and as such these experts become eligible for partnership sooner,” he added.However, most firms are investing in building the right promotion criterion for a professional to be an equity partner, and that journey may take a tad longer.",SERVICES,12

Driven by a huge expansion in China’s solar fleet, the world is inching toward a target set at theCOP28climate summit to triple renewable power by the end of the decade.“Under current policies and market conditions, global renewable capacity is already on course to increase by two-and-a-half times by 2030,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said. “It’s not enough yet to reach the COP28 goal of tripling renewables, but we’re moving closer – and governments have the tools needed to close the gap.”BloombergPlunging solar panel prices helped China to deploy a record amount of new clean power production in 2023, something that shows little sign of slowing. From 2023 to 2028, the IEA expects the nation to build about 30% more renewable capacity than the rest of the world combined. China’s growth has been so rapid that the IEA raised its six-year clean power forecast for the country by 64%.BloombergRooftop solarinstallations are key to the sector’s growth, both in China and elsewhere, as homeowners and businesses turn to the technology to cut energy bills and emissions. The so-called distributed solar sector is set to grow over 200% from 2023 to 2028, compared with the previous six years, exceeding wind power additions, according to the IEA.Wind power, however, is growing at a slower rate after supply chain issues, inflation and higher borrowing costs put projects in Europe and the US in jeopardy, particularly for offshore farms. For the US, the IEA cut its forecast for new offshore wind capacity by more than 60% after developers canceled and delayed projects due to rising costs.The agency also lowered its forecast for wind power in Europe due to project delays andpower gridcongestion.Wind power’s growth will need to pick up for the world to be on track to reach climate goals, particularly in places like northern Europe where sunshine is scarce in the winter at a time when power demand peaks.",RISE,11

"NEW DEHLI: There is a need to rationalisecustomsduties particularly in those sectors which are growing at a healthy pace for the last several decades, an official said on Thursday. The official, however, said that providing a protection of high duty is required for the infant domestic industry.""But if the industry is 40-50 years old and has developed, has good competition, good investments and if they are globally known, then they should also be competing with the global firms,"" the official argued.Normally, customs duties or tariffs are used as a policy tool to ensure a higher level of protection for certain sectors to boost domestic manufacturing.These remarks assume significance as there is demand from countries which are negotiating free-trade agreements with India to cut down import duties in sectors such as auto and alcoholic beverages.Overall duties in certain segments are up to 150 per cent like alcoholic beverages.""There is a need for balancing in the duty structure. One country has less duty and other will have high taxes, this can not happen,"" the official added.Given certain disability factors in India like high interest rates, problems in getting land and some hidden cost, there is a requirement to provide protection to domestic industries to provide a level-playing field with firms of the developed nations.But for that disability factor, one can provide a certain level of protection to domestic industry but not at the level of 100 or 150 per cent, the official argued adding ""our argument is that duties should be rationalised"".Industry body India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) has recently stated that import duty cuts on mobile phone components can increase domestic production of handsets by 28 per cent to USD 82 billion and boost exports, crucial to support indigenous manufacturing.ICEA Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo has said that the next phase of mobile manufacturing growth has to come from exports as the production for the local market is close to saturation.He has said India will need to enhance competitiveness in mobile manufacturing at the global level by matching the tariffs or reducing the cost of production with respect to countries like China and Vietnam, where import duty on most of the mobile components is nil or in a lower tax bracket.ICEA, whose members include Apple, Foxconn, Dixon, Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi, and Lava etc, has projected that lowering duties on mobile inputs, as recommended by the industry, will enhance local production of mobile phones to USD 82 billion by 2026-27 compared and USD 64 billion with business as usual.According to think tankGTRI, the countries with which India is negotiating trade agreements already have low import duties.""For example, the UK's duties are 4.1 per cent, Canada's 3.3 per cent, and the USA's 2.3 per cent.

The one-month good-faith negotiations between the two companies - agreed upon on December 20 - will end on January 21.The main hurdle to the completion of the merger is the tussle between Goenka and Sony Pictures Entertainment's top brass over who will become the CEO of the merged entity, the people said.While Sony is batting for its long-time media executive Singh, Goenka believes that the Securities Appellate Tribunal's (SAT) verdict setting aside the Sebi orders banning him from holding the top executive position has cleared the way for him to become the MD and CEO of the Sony-Zee combined entity.Another person aware of the negotiations said Sony had offered Goenka an advisory role and a board seat. ""Sony is not averse to increasing the Rs 1,100 crore non-compete fee that they will pay the Goenkas,"" the person added.Sony and Zee refused to comment.",MEDIA,8
"Online gamingfirmDelta Corpon Tuesday said theGST demandworth over Rs 23,200 crore isarbitraryand contrary to provisions of law and hence it has not made any provisions towards the same. The company, which is also a casino operator, reported a 59 per cent year-on-year decline in itsconsolidated net profitfor the quarter ended December 2023 at Rs 34.48 crore. The income from operations stood at Rs 181.54 crore, 18 per cent lower than the year-ago period.In a footnote alongside its Q3FY24 numbers, Delta Corp said that on September 27, 2023, the holding company and its two subsidiary companies received show cause notices from theDirectorate General of GST Intelligence(DGGI), Hyderabad, for alleged short payment ofGoods and Services Tax(GST) aggregating to Rs 16,822.9 crore for the period July 1, 2017, to March 31, 2022.

"Like trains didn't go out of fashion even after a hundred years of airlines in operation, television is here to stay and co-exist withOTT, according toTata PlayMD and CEOHarit Nagpal. Commenting on the debate on whether streaming services on devices could sound the death knell for television, Nagpal, in an interview to PTI, said there will always be a segment of customers opting forTVin India.""There are people who own private planes, have commercial airlines gone out of business? No! Airlines business has been around... have trains and buses gone out of fashion? No!""Of the 300 million Indian homes, 140 million are yet to buy their first TV... So, it doesn't mean that if OTT has come, TV will go. They will co-exist,"" said Nagpal, who is out with his debut book, 'Adapt: To Thrive, Not Just Survive'.Admitting that there is a segment of people who have moved from TV to OTT, the 62-year-old here talked about recognising the other available segments, like those who till now could not save enough money to buy a TV.According to Nagpal, everytime a new technology comes in and makes itself available for a particular segment of customers, there is a segment -- that has always been there -- which can only afford the older technology.""Now, if you say they'll bypass television and go straight to the mobile, but where will they afford the cost of the broadband and the content both. It is like saying 'if they can't eat the bread, why can't they eat the cake',"" he added.There are still about ""110 million paying television customers"" in this country, who are paying no less than Rs 300 a month.""And the number is not dropping,"" Nagpal, who has co-authored a case study on the subject of disruption, which is now part of the curriculum at the London Business School, added.His debut book, containing a collection of 10 stories set in different countries, investigates the idea of adaptation, which, he said, was the one thing every business needs if it wishes to evolve.""What stories do is open your mind to reading. If it is a preachy book nobody would read it, if it is a story book people will read it for fiction and in the process some learning also seeps in and settles in your mind somewhere.

"Google’s Play Store will allow a variety ofreal money gaming(RMG) apps, which let players wager actual money based on the outcome of online games, to be listed on the platform, it said in a blogpost. At the same time, thepopular app store will be charging them a service fee,adding to the pressure their margins already face due to increased indirect taxation.Here’s a deeper dive into what this means for one of the most profitable, and more recently troubled, startup ecosystems in the country:Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill CoursesOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIndian School of BusinessISB Professional Certificate in Product ManagementVisitIIM KozhikodeIIMK Senior Management ProgrammeVisitNorthwestern UniversityKellogg Post Graduate Certificate in Product ManagementVisitWhat is the change?RMG apps were traditionally not allowed on Google’s official app store. Users had to download the app’s installation file from the game’s website directly.In September 2022, Google kicked off a pilot programme in India to allow a select few RMG apps on the platform. However, only fantasy gaming platforms like Dream11 and online rummy platforms like RummyCricle were allowed. Other RMG app providers like Winzo and Zupee were only allowed to have free-to-play apps with casual games like Ludo.This is set to change from June 30 this year, as the Play Store will allow a wide variety of RMG games on its platform in India, Mexico and Brazil.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 StoriesWhat will the change mean?Industry executives think this change will influence the sector in two ways. First, the distribution of RMG apps will likely get a massive boost from the wide reach and availability of the Play Store in India - over 95% of the Indian smartphone market runs on the Android operating system.“It will especially help MSMEs and new developers/platforms who will be able to compete with established companies, and will substantially bring down the user acquisition and other associated costs,” said Roland Landers, chief executive of All India Gaming Federation, a representative body of RMG firms.Second, industry executives are wary as Google has not specified the service fee it will be charging these platforms, something that could add to the burdens these companies face after the government implemented a higher goods and services taxes (GST) of 28% last year.The Play Store currently charges anywhere from 15% to 30% as service fees on in-app purchases and app sales. In the latest post, Google said it would be “evolving” the service fee for RMG apps to “reflect the value Google Play provides”, adding that it is working with app developers to “ensure our new approach reflects the unique economics and various developer earning models of this industry.”The change also comes asRMG firms are facing pending tax notices for previous years, amounting to several thousand crore rupees.“As with a lot of other sectors, being on the Play Store could become a necessary pain - the hope is that the bump in customer acquisition will be worth the service charges levied on us,” a senior executive in the RMG industry said, declining to be identified.How did this come about?RMG apps have long faced legal battles and restrictions on the allegation that the games are dependent on chance, and not skill, with the former meaning they would be categorised as gambling - an illegal activity in many Indian states.As a result, these firms have had to fight protracted legal battles, with one currentlyongoingin the Supreme Court against rummy app maker Gameskraft. Executives in the RMG industry say that this kind of legal uncertainty could be the reason the likes of Google did not allow them on their platform.However, the apps are also extremely lucrative, bringing in strong cash flows.Who makes the decisions?In the latest directive, Google did not specify which kinds of RMG apps it would allow on the Play Store. It said the RMG apps would still be required to use geo-gating so that they are available only in regions where they are legal, besides following “existing developer policies supporting user safety.”Industry executives say this could be a key decision, as platforms that would be allowed on the Play Store would have a huge advantage in terms of reach and marketing over peers that do not get onboarded.In an earlier post, Google had said it would await for the government to recognise Self-Regulatory Bodies (SRBs) in the RMG sector to help with such decisions. ET reported on September 29 that thegovernment had deferred plans to form such bodies.When the pilot to allow some of these apps on the Play Store began in 2022, Google did not fully explain why only fantasy and rummy platforms were chosen for the pilot.“I think Google did not want to get into the mess of defining what a game of skill or chance is, so it just went with the two types of games that had faced cases in the Supreme Court and translated that as the best indicator of future risk-aversion,” the senior RMG executive quoted earlier said.While fantasy platformDream11 had prevailed in a Supreme Court judgementin August 2021, physical rummy has been declared a game of skill in earlier cases. However, it still faces achallenge in its online form in the Supreme Court, where the GST department is fighting a case against Bengaluru-based Gameskraft.",TECH,13

"With US inflation surprisingly picking up speed again, the cheerless outlook for outsourcing jobs in India may turn even gloomier.An uptick in white-collar youth unemployment may not affect Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s prospects in the upcoming elections — the glitzy temple inauguration gala he has planned for Jan. 22 may be enough to keep his core Hindu voters electrified. Still, if the downturn in large American deals extends to next year, lackluster mass consumption in the world’s most-populous nation may start to weigh on an exuberant stock market that’s betting big on a third term for Modi.Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill CoursesOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteMITMIT Technology Leadership and InnovationVisitIndian School of BusinessISB Professional Certificate in Product ManagementVisitIIM KozhikodeIIMK Advanced Data Science For ManagersVisitInfosys Ltd.’s latest results, announced shortly before the release of the US consumer price index on Thursday, reflect the challenge. Revenue from North America fell nearly 5%(1) from a year earlier in three months to December, while Europe grew by the same amount. Overall, India’s second-biggest software exporter saw a 1% slide in sales. Financial-services, technology and telecom clients led the decline.Throw in the revised guidance of 1.5% to 2% revenue expansion in the fiscal year that will end in March, and it appears quite likely that the current quarter may show a decline over the previous three months.It isn’t just Infosys that’s struggling with dismal growth.Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., which has also just reported earnings, eked out sales growth of 1.7% simply because the biggest outsourcing firm is less dependent on clients from North America, where it too saw a decline.Both TCS and Infosys are focusing on improving margins. Between them, they shed nearly 12,000 employees since September — not good news for the labor market. A fifth straight quarter of shrinking workforce is highly unusual. It’s also a clear signal that the broader industry, which employs more than 5 million people and garners nearly $250 billion in revenue, is still in the doldrums.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 StoriesAfter the pandemic-era hiring spree, the loss of jobs is a rude shock in urban India, where coding as a career has been hard-wired in the preference order of middle-class families over the past two decades.The revival that investors in Indian information technology stocks have been betting on may be some distance away. Earlier this month, Kotak Institutional Equities, a Mumbai-based brokerage, drew attention to a surprising dip in North American deals. For 21Indian outsourcingoperations, the total fell to just three between October and December, from a seven-quarter average of eight.The onset of this slump for Infosys, which garners 28% of its revenue from financial-services clients, was during the March 2023 quarter. The timing suggests a strong possibility that Wall Street firms have been reluctant to open their wallets since last year’s regional US banking crisis.The ensuing panic in the deposit market may have eased, but financial institutions are still wary of placing expensive technology orders, unless these projects show immediate cost reductions. For anything more strategic, chief financial officers would rather wait to see interest-rate cuts in full flow than take a premature bet that the fight against inflation, which began late, is now really over.India’s software industry is an odd place to look for trouble emanating from a prolonged campaign of higher US interest rates. These cash-rich firms have no debt refinancing to worry about. It’s their lumpy order flows that make them vulnerable to cycles of client sentiment.While the mood seems upbeat enough in Europe and the rest of the world, it’s still rather weak in the US. Infosys reported large deal wins of just $3.2 billion in the December quarter, down from $7.7 billion in the previous three months. TCS disclosed new assignments from the Munch Museum in Oslo for interactive exhibits, ASX Ltd., the Australian stock exchange operator, for a new clearing and settlement system, and Virgin Media O2, a British media and telecom firm, for a modern, digital workplace. The only US client the press release talked about is a healthcare company that wants its operating model to be reimagined by using cloud computing.The absence of large American orders is worrisome. In the 20-to-24-year-old age group, when college graduates start their first jobs, unemployment is as high as 45% in Indian cities. Low-end coding positions are already at risk from generative artificial intelligence. Higher-for-longer US interest rates might be making the problem worse.",TECH,13
"The telecom department’s decision to expand the scope of machine-to-machine and internet of things (M2M/IoT)registrationto all entities across segments will enablestandardisationofIoT servicesas everyone will follow a single standard that will address key issues around know your customer (KYC),securityandencryption, say experts.Going forward, artificial intelligence (AI) will also play a crucial role in amplifying capabilities of M2M systems, including prediction of security breaches.Currently, the M2M/IoT industry is operating with several separate standards and with growing types of devices,interoperabilityis becoming an issue.The telcos, however, are still waiting for the government to define critical M2M/IoT services, which, they say should only be given through licensed spectrum.“With explosive growth from about 2-3 billion devices currently to 25 billion or so, interoperability will become a key issue. Hence, basic discipline and conformance to standards becomes very important and that would be achieved through this measure,” TV Ramachandran, Broadband India Forum (BIF) president, told ET.He added that the government’s measures would boost investor confidence. “It would improve efficiencies and reduce costs across many sectors and help achieve the national goal of 25 billion IoT devices by 2030,” Ramachandran said.The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has recently issued guidelines expanding the M2M registration to all business entities, including companies, government departments, partnership firms, LLPs, institutions, proprietorship firms, societies and trusts engaged in M2M services provisioning. All these entities are required to register with DoT through the saralsanchar portal.A decision has been taken to proliferate a standards-based and secure M2M/IoT ecosystem. This also addresses the concerns of M2M service providers related to interface with telecom operators, KYC rules, security and encryption amongst others.“AI technologies play a crucial role in amplifying the capabilities of M2M systems, empowering devices to analyse, learn from data and make intelligent decisions in domains such as predictive maintenance, threat detection and identification of potential security breaches,” Anil Sood, AI governance lead at EY Canada, said.He added that the initiative by DoT is aimed at fortifying the security, transparency and reliability facets of the M2M/IoT ecosystem. “This initiative seamlessly aligns with the responsible adoption of underlying AI technologies powering M2M communication,” Sood said.The DoT has said it’s committed to building a secure and innovative M2M/IoT landscape. “Non-compliance may lead to withdrawal or disconnection of telecom resources obtained from the authorised telecom licensees,” the DoT said.National Digital Communication Policy aims at creating a robust digital communications infrastructure, enabling next generation technologies and ensuring a holistic and harmonised approach for harnessing emerging technologies such as M2M/loT.",TELECOM,14

The plans have multiple incoming/outgoing voice minutes on the IR plans.Jio’s base in-flight connectivity pack (with 1 day validity), in turn, now starts at an MRP of Rs 195 (almost 61% lower than the earlier Rs 499 MRP), offering 250 MB of data, 100 voice minutes and 100 text messages. Jio’s in-flight connectivity service is available via the AeroMobile aircraft roaming network that uses satellite systems once the aircraft is 20,000 feet above the ground. The service is available on 22 partner airlines.The telco’s pricing action around global roaming offers comes at a time when latest air travel data for November 2023 from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has reportedly indicated that global air travel has reached 99% of pre-Covid levels.Last month, Vodafone Idea (Vi) had included Maldives to the list of nations where the telco offers mobile data and voice calls with its global roaming plans. It had launched a Rs 2999 `Maldives Plan’ with 10-day validity, offering 100 minutes (outgoing/incoming calls), 5GB of data and free incoming text messages.Back in December 2022, Bharti Airtel had launched its WorldPass IR pack that automatically enables global roaming services in 184 countries. Airtel’s move then signalled a departure from regular telco IR packs which vary from country to country.More recently, Airtel’s MD Gopal Vittal had said that strong uptake of Airtel’s global roaming services had contributed to the telco’s ARPU growth in the fiscal second quarter.Jio, on its part, has launched new voice and data plans with free in-flight benefits.These IR plans come in four variants , Rs 2499, Rs 3999, Rs 4999 and Rs 5999, with 10-30 days validity. The free in-flight benefits include 100 voice minutes, 100 text messages and 250 MB of data. These benefits are applicable on 22 airlines, as per the Jio statement.",TELECOM,14
"The top position of theTelecom Regulatory Authority of India(Trai), which has been vacant for over three months, may finally get filled soon withcabinet secretaryRajiv Gauba interviewing four potential candidates on Saturday, senior officials aware of the matter told ET.“Among those interviewed include two former secretaries, one Railway Board member and a person from theDepartment of Telecommunications,” a person aware of the details said. The names of the potential candidates could not be ascertained.The Trai chairman’s post fell vacant after the retirement of PD Vaghela on September 30. Vaghela’s successor is likely to be named soon as the government wants to finalise allocation ofsatellite spectrumat the earliest, ahead of which the sector regulator needs to recommend a price for administrative allocation of the airwaves.To fill the position, the government had to invite applications for a second time last month after no candidate could be finalised, despite a few people being interviewed. The government had earlier invited applications for the position on June 22.ET had reported that in the absence of a chairman, the sector regulator has been extending deadlines for comments and counter-comments on as many as 12 papers, including critical ones on the national broadcasting policy.With the notification of the Telecommunications Act 2023, Trai’s papers on finalising the mode of satellite spectrum allocation and regulating over-the-top players have become infructuous. The Act has removed OTT services and apps from the definition of telecom services and called for administrative allocation of satellite spectrum, ruling out auctions of such airwaves.But despite that, Trai is required to give pricing and other details for administratively allocating spectrum to satcom players, which can be done when a chairman is in place.While full-time member Meenakshi Gupta has been handling the additional charge of chairman, only routine matters could be processed as she did not have the regulatory powers to make key decisions, said officials.The tenure of the chairman is up to three years or till the post holder attains the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier. A government employee, if selected as Trai chairperson, will have to retire from service before joining the post, said the DoT notification.To qualify for the post, the applicant must have special knowledge and professional experience in telecommunications, industry, finance, accountancy, law, management or consumer affairs.",TELECOM,14
